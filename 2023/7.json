  "A 64-year-old man presents with a tremor in his legs and arms. He says he has had the tremor for ’’many years’’, but it has worsened in the last year. The tremor is more prominent at rest and nearly disappears on movement. His daughter mentions that his movements have become slower. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits.
